# SQL Murder Mystery

## Introduction
The SQL Murder Mystery was created by Joon Park and Cathy He while they were Knight Lab fellows. It's a fun game for experienced SQL users to solve an intriguing crime if, like me, you love puzzles and coding in equal measure! ðŸ˜… All the clues to the murder mystery are buried in a database, and you need to use SQL to navigate the vast network of information.

## Get started
1. Take a look through the Solution.md file to see my approach to solving the murder, and the sql code I wrote to do so.
2. Have a go yourself! You can find the SQL Murder Mystery in-browser [here](https://mystery.knightlab.com/index.html) if you'd like to do the challenge in your browser.
3. If you'd like to, you can also go to the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries) for futher info and instuctions on how to download and run this challenge on your local machine.
